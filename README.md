# Cowie

This is Cowie, a discord anime bot for all the weebs as well as the non-weebs out there! Besides anime content, Cowie can play music as well. Moderation features are yet not there but will be added in future updates.
## Creator

Hey there, I am [@laughing-nerd](https://www.github.com/laughing-nerd), the creator of this bot and I welcome you all to try out Cowie :)


## Contribution

I know you guys would rather have a real life than contribute to this project. But if you wish to work on it, then you are free to do so.
Fork the repo and clone it.
Then open up terminal and execute:<br>
```
npm install
```
<br>
to install the dependencies

Of course I won't be providing the bot token, so you'll have to create a dummy bot from Discord developer portal and use its bot token.
After you have a dummy bot's token, create a .env file in the root directory and add the following line:
<br>
```
TOKEN=<token>
```
<br>
Replace &lt;token&gt; with your dummy bot's token

Then execute the following line in your terminal to start the bot:<br>
```
npm run start
```
<br><br>

## More about this project

This is a hobby project and might still have some bugs. I have no idea what I have made. Leave me alone.
